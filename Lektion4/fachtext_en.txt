Cardiology is the medical specialty concerned with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Among the most common conditions are coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias. Myocardial infarction, in particular, remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early identification of risk factors such as smoking, diabetes mellitus, or hypercholesterolemia is therefore crucial.

Various diagnostic methods are available to evaluate cardiac function. The electrocardiogram (ECG) provides information on the heart’s electrical activity and helps detect arrhythmias or ischemia. Echocardiography allows detailed assessment of valve morphology and left ventricular function, while invasive techniques such as coronary angiography visualize stenoses in the coronary arteries.

Therapeutic strategies range from pharmacological interventions — including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins — to interventional procedures such as stent implantation. Surgical measures, for example coronary artery bypass grafting, remain an important option in selected patients. Beyond acute management, long-term secondary prevention, lifestyle modification, and structured follow-up play a central role in reducing the risk of recurrent cardiac events.
