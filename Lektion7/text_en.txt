Good morning!
How are you?
The weather is nice today.
I like to drink coffee.
We are working on an interesting project.
Can you please help me?
That is a good idea.
I watched a movie yesterday.
The food was very tasty.
I often read in the evening.
At the weekend, I am going to Zurich.
My friends come from different countries.
I am currently learning Python.
The meeting starts at nine oâ€™clock.
Thank you for your help!
